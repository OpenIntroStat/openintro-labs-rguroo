The Human Freedom Index is a report that attempts to summarize the idea of "freedom"
through a bunch of different variables for many countries around the globe.
It serves as a rough objective measure for the relationships between the different
types of freedom - whether it's political, religious, economical or personal freedom -
and other social and economic circumstances. The Human Freedom Index is an anually
co-published report by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and the Liberales
Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom.

In this lab, you'll be analyzing data from Human Freedom Index reports from 2008-2016.
Your aim will be to summarize a few of the relationships within the data both 
graphically and numerically in order to find which variables can help tell a story
about freedom.

## Getting Started

### The data

The data we're working with is in the `OpenIntro` **Dataset Repository** and it's called *hfi*, short for Human Freedom Index.

1.  What are the dimensions of the dataset? (How many rows, how many columns?)

1.  What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between the personal
    freedom score, *pf_score*, and one of the other numerical variables? Plot 
    this relationship using the variable *pf_expression_control* as the predictor. Use the appropriate function in Rguroo's **Plots** toolbox. Does the relationship look linear? If you knew a country's *pf_expression_control*,
    or its score out of 10, with 0 being the most, of political pressures and 
    controls on media content, would you be comfortable using a linear model to
    predict the personal freedom score? 



If the relationship looks linear, we can quantify the strength of the
relationship with the correlation coefficient. In the Rguroo tab showing your graph, click ![Basics](../icon_images/basics2_Selected.png) and check the `Show Correlation and LS Equation` box.

## The linear model

It is rather cumbersome to try to get the correct least squares line, i.e. the 
line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, through trial and error. However, it is quite easy to obtain the model in Rguroo. In your plot, click ![Basics](../icon_images/basics2_Selected.png) and check the `LS Line` button. Your plot should now show the least squares line and, if you also checked the box earlier to show the correlation, the equation of the line should be shown above the plot.

To get more information about the line, in the **Analytics** toolbox section, select **Linear Regression**. In the dialog, select *hfi* as the `Dataset` and *pf_score* as the `Response`. In the `Formula` box, type *pf_expression_control* as shown in the screenshot below:

```{r linreg1, echo= FALSE, results = "asis", fig.cap = "*Creating the least-squares model in Rguroo*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/linear-regression-1.png")
```

The most important part of the output is the **Regression Coefficients Estimates** table:

```{r linreg1 output, echo= FALSE, results = "asis", fig.cap = "*The Regression Coefficients Estimates table for the least-squares model*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/linear-regression-1-output.png")
```

Let's consider this output piece by piece. Its first column displays the linear model's y-intercept and the slope coefficient corresponding to *pf_expression_control*.
With this table, we can write down the least squares regression line for the 
linear model:

\[
  \hat{y} = 4.6171 + 0.49143 \times pf\_expression\_control
\]

One last piece of information we will discuss from the summary output is the 
**Multiple R-squared**, or more simply, $R^2$. This value can be found in the table helpfully labeled **Model Summary: Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared)**. The $R^2$ value represents the 
proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the 
explanatory variable. For this model, 63.42% of the variability in *pf_score* is 
explained by *pf_expression_control*.

In Rguroo, the model and report need to be saved separately. Click the **Save** button, then save both the **Model** and **Report** as *hfi_model1*.

1.  Fit a new model that uses *pf_expression_control* to predict *hf_score*, or
    the total human freedom score. Using the estimates from the Rguroo output, write 
    the equation of the regression line. What does the slope tell us in the 
    context of the relationship between human freedom and the amount of political
    pressure on media content?

## Prediction and prediction errors

Go back to the scatterplot with the least squares line laid on top.

This line can be used to predict $y$ at any value of $x$. When predictions are 
made for values of $x$ that are beyond the range of the observed data, it is 
referred to as *extrapolation* and is not usually recommended. However, 
predictions made within the range of the data are more reliable. They're also 
used to compute the residuals.

1.  If someone saw the least squares regression line and not the actual data, how
    would they predict a country's personal freedom score for one with a 6.7 rating
    for *pf_expression_control*? Is this an overestimate or an underestimate, and
    by how much? In other words, what is the residual for this prediction?

## Model diagnostics

To assess whether the linear model is reliable, we need to check for (1) 
linearity, (2) nearly normal residuals, and (3) constant variability.

**Linearity**: You already checked if the relationship between *pf_score* and 
*pf_expression_control* is linear using a scatterplot. We should also verify this
condition with a plot of the residuals vs. fitted (predicted) values.

This plot can be found in Rguroo's Linear Regression output as the plot labeled **Residuals vs. Fit**.

```{r residual plot, echo= FALSE, results = "asis", fig.cap = "*The Residuals vs. Fit plot generated by Rguroo*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/res_fit.png")
```

The red dashed line is a horizontal line at $y = 0$ (to help us check whether the residuals are distributed around 0), and the green line is a moving average of sorts (to help us look for underlying patterns).


1.  Is there any apparent pattern in the residuals plot? What does this indicate
    about the linearity of the relationship between the two variables?  


**Nearly normal residuals**: To check this condition, we can look at a histogram of the residuals. To do this, we need to save the residuals as an Rguroo dataset. Click ![Details](../icon_images/details.png), go to the `Diagnostic Indices Table` section, and check `Include Diagnostics Table`. Then `Preview` ![eye](../icon_images/preview.png) the output to re-run the model.

Now we can save the dataset. Open the `Diagnostics Indices Table` section again and `Save Table as` *hfi_residuals*.

```{r save table, echo= FALSE, results = "asis", fig.cap = "*Saving the residuals as an Rguroo dataset*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/diagnostic-table-1.png")
```

Once you have the dataset saved, you can make a histogram of the *hfi_residuals* dataset, using the `Variable` *Residuals*.

In Rguroo, it is much less work to look at a normal probability plot of the residuals, as the plot is shown in the default Rguroo output and labeled **Normal Probability Plot: Residuals**.

```{r qq-res, echo= FALSE, results = "asis", fig.cap = "*The Normal Probability Plot generated by Rguroo*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/qq_res.png")
```

1.  Based on the histogram and normal probability plot, does the nearly 
    normal residuals condition appear to be met?


**Constant variability**: To check this condition, look again at the **Residuals vs. Fit** plot you examined earlier.


1.  Based on the residuals vs. fitted plot, does the constant variability condition 
    appear to be met?

## More Practice
<div class="oyo">

-   Choose another freedom variable and a variable you think would strongly
    correlate with it. Produce a scatterplot of the two variables and fit a 
    linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship?

-   How does this relationship compare to the relationship between 
    *pf_expression_control* and *pf_score*? Use the $R^2$ values from the two 
    model summaries to compare. Does your independent variable seem to predict
    your dependent one better? Why or why not?


-   What's one freedom relationship you were most surprised about and why? Display
    the model diagnostics for the regression model analyzing this relationship.
