OpenIntro Labs - Rguroo
==============

OpenIntro Labs promote the understanding and application of statistics through applied data analysis. Labs are titled based on topic area, which correpond to particular chapters in all three versions of OpenIntro Statistics, a free and open-source textbook. The textbook as well as the html version of the labs can be found at [http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php](http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php).

This repository is a fork of the [tidyverse labs](https://github.com/openintrostat/oilabs-tidy). It incorporates the [Rguroo](https://rguroo.com/) web-based statistical software. Since Rguroo is primarily GUI-based, most code chunks have been replaced with screenshots.

Put something here about the difficulty of using markdown/notebooks with Rguroo.

We currently support our source files in the RMarkdown (.Rmd) format, which can be output into
html format (though output to pdf is also possible). The source files are processed
using the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package in R, and are easiest to use in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

## Feedback / collaboration

Your feedback is most welcomed! If you have suggestions for minor updates (fixing typos, etc.) please do not hesitate to issue a pull request. If you have ideas for major revamp of a lab (replacing outdated code with modern version, overhaul in 
pedagogy, etc.) please create an issue so to start the conversation.
